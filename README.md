# Data-Project-1
# Project 1 --> Data Analysis and Visualization working with National Tornado Data
###  - The goal of this project, being the first one and only one semester into college, is to practice working with a data set in Python 
### - I use very basic data visualization techniques such as bar graphs and scatter plots with linear regression, but I also used the opportunity to teach myself and practice some more complicated yet interesting graphical representations of the data such as creating a graph that shows the borders of the US and the exact longitute/latitude coordinates of tornado spawn points as read in from the data file
### - Statistically, the calculations are basic, but the goal of this project was for me to practice using Python to read in data and work with data as I was still relatively new to everything
